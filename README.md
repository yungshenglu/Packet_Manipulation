# Packet Manipulation via Scapy

This repository is a lab for NCTU course "Introduction to Computer Networks 2018".

---
## Abstract

In this lab we are going to learn how to use Scapy - a powerful interactive packet manipulation program, which can forge or decode packets of a wide number of protocols, send them on wire, capture them, match requests and replies, and much more.

---
## Objectives

This lab aims to learn how we use Scapy and Python to program a simple network protocol and observe the behavior of packet sending and receiving via Wireshark.

1. Basic knowledge of Docker
2. Linux networking
3. Python with Scapy
4. Wireshark
5. Git & GitHub
